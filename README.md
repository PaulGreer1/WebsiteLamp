## WebsiteLamp

This is a powerful Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP (LAMP) website with tools for membership, customer relationship management (CRM), brochure, financials, etc.. We use our own proprietary PHP-based model-view-controller (MVC) system. Take it, install it, enjoy it!

This repository will start you off with the following website:

https://www.ukappcoder.com/index.php

The site is powered by a set of PHP/MySQL web apps. Each app has an MVC structure, and includes the following mimimal set of files:

- Config.php

- Content.php

- controller.php

The HTML output from any particular app is generated by the app's Content.php file. The output is styled by the three CSS files in the root directory.

Use the top level Config.php file to configure the system for your server, then copy this file to all the other app directories.
